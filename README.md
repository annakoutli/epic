Adding forth welcome-feature widget on epic theme on genesis framework
====

It is a specific fix on the epic theme http://my.studiopress.com/themes/epik/

from the beloved Genesis framework http://www.studiopress.com/ for wordpress of course.

You only need to change the home.php and style.css files locadede on the root directory of the theme folder.

It adds one more area evenly placed, that behaves the same way as the others on mobiles.
